and [DEV Community](https://dev.to/gin_mitch/dynamic-translations-in-angular-made-possible-525n).

## Quick Start & Notice

While this project is not a role model of a great UX design,
it features a fully-functional implementation of lazy-loaded translations.

To start the project:
- Run `npm ci` to install dependencies
- Run `npm start` to compile the app

Open DevTools in your browser to see language files being loaded at run-time,
navigate to "Tab 2" and see an additional module-specific translations being loaded.

Get back to "Tab 1", change the language and watch the text being updated without reloading the whole page.
